### Instructions: 

1. Install BTree library with `pip install BTrees`

2. Each script is run with the path of the test file as a command-line argument

3. Run Q1_hash.py first, then Q1_btree.py

Ex:
>>python Q1_hash.py test_file.txt

and

>>python Q1_btree.py test_file.txt

4. The scripts will output separate tables for the hash and btree scripts as txt files, and a third txt file containing the run-time of each method.
